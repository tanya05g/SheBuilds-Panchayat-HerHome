# AI Roommate Matching System

An intelligent roommate matching system powered by AI and machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Matching**: Uses Sentence-BERT, KNN, SVD, and Logistic Regression for optimal roommate matching
- **Voice Assistant Integration**: Compatible with Omnidim.io Voice Assistant for seamless data collection
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Get instant roommate matches with compatibility scores
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful React frontend with Tailwind CSS

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ML Models**: Sentence-BERT, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVD, Logistic Regression
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, Surprise, pandas, sentence-transformers
